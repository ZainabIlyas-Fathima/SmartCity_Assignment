#  Smart City Navigation System
**Assignment: Data Structures & Algorithms** - CCS2300 Assignment

## 👤 Project Information
# Smart City Management System 

## Team Members & Responsibilities
* **Member 1:** Fathima Zainab Ilyas - Module 1: Graph Implementation, Location/Road Management, Traversal Logic.
* **Member 2:** Thakshila - Module 2: Sorting Algorithms & Performance Comparison.
* **Member 3:** Lashini - Module 3: Searching Algorithms & Tree-based Organization.

## Project Structure
* `Module 1`: Contains the Adjacency List Graph and BST for location storage.
* `Module 2`: Contains Bubble, Merge, and Quick Sort implementations.
* `Module 3`: Contains the searching logic and performance analyzer.

* **Core Logic:** Graph-based city mapping and pathfinding.


## 📖 Project Overview
This system models a "Smart City" where various locations (nodes) are connected by roads (edges). It uses optimized algorithms to calculate distances and manage urban navigation data.

### Core Modules:
* `CityGraph.java`: Manages the adjacency list and graph logic.
* `Location.java`: Defines the attributes of each city node.
* `SmartCityApp.java`: The main entry point and user interface.

## Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/Zainabllyas-Fathima/SmartCity_Assignment.git](https://github.com/Zainabllyas-Fathima/SmartCity_Assignment.git)

   Open in VS Code: Ensure you have the Java Extension Pack installed.

## Team Contribution Protocol
1. Synchronize Before Coding:  git pull origin main
2. Do not push directly to the main branch
   git checkout -b member2-feature
3. Coding Standards
Preservation: Do not modify CityGraph.java or Location.java without discussing it with me
Modularity: Create new files for your tasks (e.g., SearchUtility.java).
Integration: Only add your menu calls inside the main method of SmartCityApp.java.
4. Submission & Review
Once your task is complete and tested:
Stage & Commit: git add . -> git commit -m "Finished Module [X]"
Push: git push origin [your-branch-name]
