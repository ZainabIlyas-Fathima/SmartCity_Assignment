#  Smart City Navigation System
**Assignment: Data Structures & Algorithms**

## 👤 Project Information
* **Lead Developer (Member 1):** Zainab Ilyas Fathima (CIT-24-02-0182)
* **Repository Status:** Private (Team Access Only)
* **Core Logic:** Graph-based city mapping and pathfinding.


## 📖 Project Overview
This system models a "Smart City" where various locations (nodes) are connected by roads (edges). It uses optimized algorithms to calculate distances and manage urban navigation data.

### Core Modules:
* `CityGraph.java`: Manages the adjacency list and graph logic.
* `Location.java`: Defines the attributes of each city node.
* `SmartCityApp.java`: The main entry point and user interface.

## Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/Zainabllyas-Fathima/SmartCity_Assignment.git](https://github.com/Zainabllyas-Fathima/SmartCity_Assignment.git)

   Open in VS Code: Ensure you have the Java Extension Pack installed.

## Team Contribution Protocol
1. Synchronize Before Coding:  git pull origin main
2. Do not push directly to the main branch
   git checkout -b member2-feature
3. Coding Standards
Preservation: Do not modify CityGraph.java or Location.java without discussing it with me
Modularity: Create new files for your tasks (e.g., SearchUtility.java).
Integration: Only add your menu calls inside the main method of SmartCityApp.java.
4. Submission & Review
Once your task is complete and tested:
Stage & Commit: git add . -> git commit -m "Finished Module [X]"
Push: git push origin [your-branch-name]
